# Snake Game AI  

This project implements a Snake game AI using reinforcement learning with Q-learning and a neural network. The AI learns to navigate the game by maximizing rewards and avoiding obstacles.  

## Features  
- Built with Python using `pygame`, `torch`, and `numpy`  
- Q-learning with a neural network for decision-making  
- Real-time training visualization with `matplotlib`  

## Usage  
Install dependencies:  
```bash
pip install pygame numpy torch matplotlib pygame_gui
```
Run the training script:
```
python agent.py
```
